#Welcome to the Purple Cow Project Folder
This file explains how to run this proof of concept locally as well as plans for future releases

##How to run this application locally (warning: these instructions are for Windows users only)
1. Python 3.xxx should be installed on your computer prior to running this application. If it has not been installed, the latest verion can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Clone the repository from Github

3. The following steps should be followed using Command Prompt

4. Navigate to the Project Purple Cow folder

5. Enter the command "python -m http.server 3000"

6. Open Chrome and go to http://localhost:3000/ 


##Project Requirements
Must Haves
1. Web application interface that uses Javascript and HTML that is served on port 3000
2. Use the https://countapi.xyz/ api to manage counting;
a. Key: 1ccb732e-b55a-4404-ad3f-0f99c02fe44e [Note: this not a secret]
3. Provide a single button to “hit” the counting api and display the current number of
hits
4. Runs locally with a single startup command
5. Should run correctly in Chrome; don’t worry about cross-browser compatibility
6. Includes a solution.md that provides relevant documentation including how to build
and run the solution

Nice to Haves
1. Includes a Dockerfile that will run and serve the web application
8 Market Place, Suite 304, Baltimore, MD 21202
(410) 394-9600 / fax (410) 779-3706 / fearless.tech
2. Any components are reusable (i.e. could have multiple copies on the same page)
3. The port the solution is served on is configurable and documented in the solution.md
4. Implements other features to demonstrate your skills


##Assumptions
- Project requirements are still being narrowed down by the customer 

##Changes for Future Releases
- The current state of the application is very basic. Would like to use Angular to create a more complex, yet efficient website
- Create a full end-to-end mock-up that would clearly state requirements for each page
- Add pages with geolocation searching in order to find free covid testing and vaccines
- Add a swag market to help fund the project
- Create a Quarantine Resources page that would provide those in quarantine with supplies, such as food, water, medical supplies, online schooling, etc
- Create a preventative health page that would provide article on how to stay healthy
